# Flow Matching and Diffusion Models practice exercises

This repository contains my personal practice work with flow matching and diffusion models, featuring lab exercises from MIT's 6.S184 "Introduction to Flow Matching and Diffusion Models" course. The labs provide hands-on experience building generative AI models from scratch, covering stochastic differential equations, score matching, and conditional image generation.
